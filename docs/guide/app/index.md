# BEPP App 

![HEADER](/banner/bepp-app-banner.png)

The `BEPP application` is a tool designed to simplify the process of packaging cross-platform extensions.


## Description

With **BEPP**, you can easily convert your extension for _Safari_, _Chrome_, _Firefox_, _Edge_, _Brave_ and other popular browsers, all from a single platform.
In addition, the application allows you to search for extensions on the web and convert them. Forget about the complications of adapting your extension for each browser separately; **BEPP** makes it quick and easy so you can focus on what really matters.
